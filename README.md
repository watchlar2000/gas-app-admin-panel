# gas-app

This is my first VueJS pet project.

1. This admin panel is going to collect, store and display information about the gas stations located within the city/region.
2. The information is going to be collected by receiving the feedback from the users (e.g. truck drivers).
3. No sign-in/sign-up (for now).
